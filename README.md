# Employee Management System

## Overview

The Employee Management System is a Java Swing application that allows you to manage employee records efficiently. It provides a graphical user interface for performing various employee-related tasks, such as adding new employees, updating their information, and generating reports. The system uses a MySQL database as its backend to store and retrieve employee data.

## Features

- **Employee Records**: Add, view, edit, and delete employee records.
- **Search**: Easily find employees by name, ID, or other criteria.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on employee details, including salary reports and attendance reports.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system to control access to the system.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL to store and manage employee data.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A user-friendly graphical interface created with Java Swing.
